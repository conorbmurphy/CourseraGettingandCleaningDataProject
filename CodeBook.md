After running run_analysis.R, a file named step5.txt is created which has the means for measures with mean (mean) or standard deviation (std).

# Variables

30 subjects were used in this experiment so the numbers 1:30 in the "subject" column are unique identifiers for each subject

6 activities were monitoried and are labled in the "activities" column

The 68 remaining variables are those with measures for mean or standard deviation.  Please see the README.txt and features_info.txt in the dataset for additional information
